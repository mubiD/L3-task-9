# Task 9 : Creating a TODOLIST Application with JWT | Level 3.

## In order to access application use the following details:

// CHANGE USERNAMER AND PASSWORD
### Username: mubashir
### Password: dollie

In this exercise, the app.js file contains all relevant code and resources for the server.

### Instructions

Make sure Reacts proxy matches the servers port number before starting Express and React.

Once you've followed both React and Express instructions, you should see the application on port 8080.

This application allows the user to create their own version of a TODOLIST Application using JWT(Jsonwebtokens). Furthermore, the users account will have to be created with an admin user who has access to the database.
Once the user has full access, they can start creating and removing todos on their own account, all the information created and removed will reflect in the MongoDB collection.
